    "# Skip Gram for Word Embeddings (Word Vectors) Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through the Skip-Gram model proposed by [Mikolov et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf). The purpose of this tutorial is more about the architecture of the model rather than the estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>IMPORTANT</b>: Here, I only discuss training the model with gradient descent, however as practitioners will know, this is inefficient with large databases. As a result, [Mikolov et al](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf) released another paper with a technique known as negative sampling, which trains only a subset of weights each epoch. This would be more effective in obtaining word vectors with an actual text database. This will be the topic of a subsequent tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example ##\n",
    "Textual analysis is a booming field with practical applications in social science. The first thing to consider in most textual analyses is the representation of words in a computer program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: <i>we think uncertainty about unemployment</i><br>\n",
    "Example 2: <i>uncertainty and fears about inflation</i><br>\n",
    "Example 3: <i>we think fears about unemployment</i><br>\n",
    "Example 4: <i>we think fears and uncertainty about inflation and unemployment</i><br>\n",
    "Example 5: <i>constant negative press covfefe</i><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, there are 12 unique words: and, about, constant, unemployment, uncertainty, fears, we, negative, inflation, press, think, covfefe\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Hot Representation ##\n",
    "One common way of representing words is with a <b>one-hot encoded</b> vector. This would be a vector of length 12 where each index represents one of the 12 unique words. We can represent each word with such a vector, with a 1 at the index of the word and zero everywhere else. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can represent the word <i>fears</i> as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\small{\\begin{array}{|cccccccccccc|}\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why use word vectors/embeddings? ###\n",
    "One issue with this representation is how to relate two words. How is the word <i>fears</i> related to the word <i>uncertainty</i>? They both contain length 12, have a 1 only in one index and 0 everywhere else. Essentially, all individual words are the same distance from each other. Note that if we were to calculate the distances between words, <i>fears</i> would be the same distance to <i>covfefe</i>; <i>fears</i> would be the same distance to <i>uncertainty</i>; and <i>uncertainty</i> would be the same distance to <i>covfefe</i>\n",

    "Word vectors, or [word embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding), solve this issue. They map words to some arbitrary H-dimensional space, $\\mathbb{R}^H$, where semantic and syntactic similarities are preserved. Below provides an example of these 12 words mapped into a 3-Dimensional space. The 3-Dimensional vectors were obtained using the Skip-Gram model proposed by Mikolov et al. Notice, that words <i>fear</i> and <i>uncertainty</i> appear alongisde each, as do the words <i>inflation</i> and <i>unemployment</i>, suggesting similar meanings (with respect to their usage in sentences) through syntax and semantics. \n",

    "## Overview of Skip-Gram Model to Obtain Word Embeddings ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The Skip-Gram Model aims to understand the link between words in sentences, and their context. For example, in Example 1, <i>we think uncertainty about unemployment</i>, consider the word <i>uncertainty</i>. The words within it's immediate proximity are <i>think</i> and <i>about</i>. Word embeddings leverage the information that similar words typically show up with similar contexts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Skip-Gram Model aims to use as input the one-hot encoded vector for the word <i>uncertainty</i> and output the word <i>think</i> and the word <i>about</i>, each represented as their own one-hot encoded vector. Let's take the input <i>uncertainty</i> and output <i>think</i>. Below is an image of the neural network at work (it might look daunting at first, so I'll try to explain each step below!).\n",
