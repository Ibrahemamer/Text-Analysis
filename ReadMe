# Text-Analysis
Explaining textual analysis tools in Python. Including Preprocessing, Skip Gram (word2vec), and Topic Modelling. 

This is not a module for large scale use, but rather a set of scripts to explain the methodologies.

## Preprocessing ##

Text_Preprocessing: explains common ways of representing text data in Python through one-hot encoded vectors, cleaning data with removal of stopwords and lowercasing, and TF-IDF weights.

## EM-Algorithm ##

EM_Algorithm: explains how to estimate a distribution using the EM-Algorithm. This is a precursor to the topic modelling example.

## Gibbs Sampling ##

Gibbs_Sampling: explains how Gibbs sampling works in the context of topic modelling. 

## Skip Gram ##

Skip_Gram: explains how the Skip Gram model from Mikolov et al. works (with gradient descent and no negative sampling).
